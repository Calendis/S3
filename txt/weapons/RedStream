Feskin's Stream MkII is for those who love the simple and accurate design of the Stream, but crave more power. The Stream MkII features higher-density flux lines that allow it to produce a projectile that deals twice the damage of the Stream MkI! Be warned, however, that the Stream MkII will also overheat twice as fast. The fire rate of the Stream MkII is identical to that of the Stream MkI.
