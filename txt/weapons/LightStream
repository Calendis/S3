Feskin's Stream MkIII is not a power upgrade like MkII was to MkI! MkIII aims to bring greater efficiency to the Stream line of weapons. While doing only half the damage of a conventional Stream MkI (and a quarter the damage of a powerful Stream MkII), the Stream MkIII runs five times as cool as a Stream MkI (and ten times as cool as a Stream MkII)! The Stream MkIII also has an improved fire rate to the MkI. If you are a pilot that prefers cool, clean, efficiency to brute force, then we recommend a Stream MkIII.
