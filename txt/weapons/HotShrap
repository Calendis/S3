The ShrapnelBlaster MkII is a questionable weapon. Like its predecessor, the MkII blasts a large amount of high-speed shrapnel at your enemies. The MkII, however, comes with an internal heating unit that lets the shrapnel glow white-hot as it exits the gun. Because of this, the ShrapnelBlaster MkII is an incredibly destructive weapon that can obliterate even capital ships. The downside is that of course, this gun will overheat faster than you can say "this was a mistake".
