Hafna Labs delivers a serious punch with the HPBall, their upgraded model of the GBall. The HPBall addresses previous complaints about the GBall projectiles travelling too slowly, as well as increased damage. In fact, the HPBall provides the highest damage-to-shot ratio of any weapon on the market. The HPBall does, however, have lower heat efficiency than the GBall, as well as lower accuracy.
