Forlorn Tech's Teslabeam is a unique weapon. with a seriously high damage-to-shot ratio. At first glance it may look like another run-of-the-mill high-damage output, high-heating gun, akin to a ShrapnelBlaster MkII, a Stream MkII, or an HPBall. However, the Teslabeam is actually moderately efficient, and with its low fire rate, you are unlikely to experience the characteristic severe heating problems that come with such weapons. If you are willing to give this weapon's bizzare specifications a try, you might find a new favourite.
