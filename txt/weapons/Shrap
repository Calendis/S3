Bandit General's ShrapnelBlaster provides a very... interesting way of destroying your target. Doing away with all known conventions on accuracy, projectile standards, and conventional weapon-engineering, the ShrapnelBlaster does as its name implies: blasts a very wide array of scrap metal into the space in front of you. You'll just have to hope it makes it mark. This scrap metal approach also means that the ShrapnelBlaster tends to do a rather unpredictable amount of damage. Shot-for-shot, the ShrapbelBlaster overheats much less slowly than a Feskin Stream, but in actuality it overheats at around three times the rate due to its high fire rate.
